Spam Detection Using ML
Spam is an email sent in bulk where there is no direct agreement in place between the recipient and the
sender to receive email solicitation. To prevent the delivery of this so-called spam, an automated tool
called a spam filter is used to recognize spam. The circular nature of these definitions along with their
appeal to the intent of sender and recipient make them difficult to formalize. The spam problem seems
to persist and the current state-of-the-art techniques in fighting this problem seem not to provide full
proof. Several approaches try to stop or reduce the huge amount of spam on
individuals. These approaches include legislative measures such as anti-spam laws world-wide.
Other techniques are known as Origin-Based filters which are based on using network information and
IP addresses to detect whether a message is spam or not. The most common techniques are
the filtering techniques attempting to identify whether a message is spam or not based on the content
and other characteristics of the message. In this paper, we present a technique for spam filtering using
Artificial Neural Networks, and the perceptron learning rule.
